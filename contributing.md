If not, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/willf/joyfully/issues/new)!

We use GitHub Flow to manage changes to this repository. If you're not familiar with GitHub Flow, we recommend [this guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). If you're ready to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Perhaps create an issue to discuss your proposed changes.
3. Make your changes in a new git branch:
   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
   ```
4. Create your changes, **including appropriate test cases**.
5. Create a pull request.

## Contribute documentation

Use the same process as for contributing code! Code is data! Data is code!
